#### Results:
Some facts we can pull out from the above data: 
- Urban cities are significantly more popular for ride sharing.
- The average fare and driver fare is significantly higher in rural cities.
- The end of February seems to peak for all city types in fare amount.
- Urban cities makes more than twice the total fares as suburban cities in total.
- Suburban cities makes more than three times the total fares of rural cities.
- Urban city types are the only location that have more drivers than rides.

#### Suggestions going forward: 
- It would be worth looking more into rural areas and making a decision to either promote ride sharing to increase rides _or_ remove the option from rural areas all together. 
- There may want to be a limit on the number of drivers in urban areas as this is the only location that has more drivers than rides. This means across the time the data was collected that there are almost 800 drivers that never did a ride. 
- If we were to limit the drivers as mentioned above we should collect data on the time of day there are the most rides vs drivers. Maybe it can be limited by time of day rather than an overall limit.
